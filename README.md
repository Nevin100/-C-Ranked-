# 💻 C-Ranked: The Complete C Language Journey 🚀

Welcome to **C-Ranked** – my no-nonsense, all-killer-no-filler journey through the **entire C programming language**. 🧠💥  
From **Hello, World!** to **pointers and memory management**, this repo is a chronologically curated vault of everything I learned in C — with notes, examples, mini-projects, and cringe-worthy beginner mistakes I now proudly own. 😎

> 🗓️ Started ~1 year ago (approx). Not abandoned — just completed. This was the course that made me *think like a programmer*.

A mix of structured notes, code files, and practice problems — sorted **chapter-wise**, **topic-wise**, and sometimes... **rage-quit-wise**.

### 📘 Topics Covered

- 🧠 **Basics & Syntax** – Variables, Data Types, Input/Output
- 🔁 **Loops & Conditions** – `for`, `while`, `if`, `switch`
- 🧮 **Functions** – Declaration, Definition, Recursion
- 📦 **Arrays & Strings** – Multi-dimensional arrays, manipulations
- 🧭 **Pointers** – Dereferencing, pointer arithmetic

## 🧑‍💻 Why I Built This Repo

Because C isn't just a language — it's a **mindset**.  
This repo was my **digital notebook**, revision kit, and punching bag when things didn’t compile (which was often).  
If you’re new to C, or looking for a structured, learner-style journey — **you’re in the right place**.

## 📦 Requirements

- 💻 A C compiler (GCC recommended)
- 📝 VS Code, Turbo C, Code::Blocks – Pick your poison
- 💡 A little patience and a lot of semicolons
